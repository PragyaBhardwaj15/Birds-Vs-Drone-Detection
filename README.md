### Birds-Vs-Drone-Detection


## AIM
 
To create a Birds & Drones Detection System, the challenge goal of te system  is to detect a drone appearing at some time in a short video sequence where birds are also present.

## Objectives

• The main objective of the project is to create a program which can be either run on Jetson nano or any pc with YOLOv5 installed and start detecting using the camera module on the device.

• Using appropriate datasets for recognizing and interpreting data using machine learning.

• To show on the optical viewfinder of the camera module, the challenge goal is to detect a drone appearing at some time in a short video sequence where birds are also present.


## Abstract :

The challenge aims at attracting research efforts to identify novel solutions to the problem outlined above, i.e., discrimination between birds and drones at far distance, by providing a video dataset that may be difficult to obtain (drone flying require special conditions and permissions, and shore areas are needed for the considered problem). 

The challenge goal is to detect a drone appearing at some time in a short video sequence where birds are also present: the algorithm should raise an alarm and provide a position estimate only when a drone is present, while not issuing alarms on birds.

We have completed this project on jetson nano which is a very small computational device.

• A lot of research is being conducted in the field of Computer Vision and Machine Learning (ML), where machines are trained to identify various objects from one another. Machine Learning provides various techniques through which various objects can be detected.

• One such technique is to use YOLOv5 with Roboflow model, which generates a small size trained model and makes ML integration easier.

The dataset is continually increased over consecutive installments of the challenge and made available to the community afterwards.

Small drones are a rising threat due to their possible misuse for illegal activities such as smuggling of drugs as well as for terrorism attacks using explosives or chemical weapons. 

The use of video analytics can solve the issue.
